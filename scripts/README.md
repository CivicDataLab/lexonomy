This folder contains various administrative scripts for Lexonomy. The most important of them is `init.js` which you need to run when setting up a new installation of Lexonomy â€“ more about that in [Local installation](https://github.com/michmech/lexonomy/wiki/Local-installation) in the repository's wiki.

This folder is **not** part of the Lexonomy web application and does not need to be present on the web server.
